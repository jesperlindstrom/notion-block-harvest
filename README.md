# Notion block for Harvest

![Notion block for Harvest Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/SlGBtYY.png)

A simple web page that displays a weekly report from Harvest, styled to blend in as a Notion "embed" block. This project is mostly a small internal experiment at [Sharpmind](https://sharpmind.se) - i.e. don't expect any future work ✌️.

## Installation

[Generate a Harvest access token](https://id.getharvest.com/developers), copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and enter the values in there.

Apart from that, the solution can be run and deployed like a normal Next.js project, e.g.:

```
$ npm install
```

```
$ npm run dev
```
