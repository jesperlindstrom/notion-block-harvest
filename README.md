A simple web page that displays a weekly report from Harvest, styled to blend in as a Notion "embed" block.

## Installation

[Generate a Harvest access token](https://id.getharvest.com/developers), copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and enter the values in there.

Apart from that, the solution can be run and deployed like a normal Next.js project, e.g.:

```
$ npm install
```

```
$ npm run dev
```
